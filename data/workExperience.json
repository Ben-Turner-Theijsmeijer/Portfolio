        "introduction": "For my final two work terms as an undergraduate student here at the University of Guelph I have been working for a software development company called Camis. I have now completed two work terms at Camis and am now returning to my academic studies with the aim to complete my final year as an undergraduate student. My position at Camis was as a Data Developer Co-op, I work closely with my supervisor Josh Janicas to oversee most of our data warehousing and ELT needs, along with some software maintenance and feature development on the side. \n\n In light of the completion of my Summer 2024 work term I am writing this report to make note of my continued activities at Camis and the initiatives I participated in over the past few months.",
        "aboutTheEmployer": "Camis is a software company located in Guelph at 130 Research Ln, not too far from the university of Guelph conveniently enough, with a few other facilities scattered about Canada and the USA. Camis is a software development company that specializes in reservation and park management solutions. Camis works in partnership with over 500 national, state, provincial, county, regional parks, conservation authorities, harbors and marinas across Canada and the United States to deliver a centralized park reservation, booking, sales, and management system. \n\n Along with the development and management of their software, the current version being called Camis 5, they also operate an in house call centre that runs concurrently with and compliments the solutions they create where highly trained staff are ready and waiting to help the customers of the various parks they are in partnership with create bookings and answer questions over the phone or on a live web chat. \n\n During the summer 2024 work term we said goodbye to two of our co-op colleagues, Adina and Amro, who were only on co-op for one term. We also welcomed a new co-op student named Zoe who would be taking over in the QA role Amro previously occupied. Camis is eager to nurture the next generation of developers. Each of us worked with a different squad within the company so we never got the chance to collaborate together on any initiatives but we all still found time to talk and have some fun.",
